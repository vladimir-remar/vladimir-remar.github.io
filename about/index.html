  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>I was born in <a 
  href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huancayo">Huancayo-Peru</a>, I 
  lived the first years of my childhood in this city, at that time I 
  lived in my grandparents' house and we shared the house with 
  uncles, cousins and grandparents, it could be said that there was 
  life on all four sides of the house . According to my father, my 
  grandparents were engaged in agriculture and a large part of the 
  family as well, a circumstance that allowed me to interact with 
  farm animals (cows, sheep, etc.)</p>
  
  <p> 
  After a couple of years we moved to Lima, where I lived until I was 
  14 years old before traveling to Barcelona Spain, where I currently 
  live.

  My first experience with a computer was an Intel Pentium 4, with 
  which I discovered my passion for technology. And to more 
  astonishment was to discover programming languages. One of the first 
  that I discovered was C ++ with which I started basic programs, later 
  I got into python, which opened up a better understanding of the 
  "rules of the game" at the time of writing code.

  But not only technology is part of my life, it is also music as well 
  as sport.
  </p>

  <p>
  My passion for music is born by the constant search for something 
  more, something that brings me another kind of satisfaction, from 
  there my love for the Bass, so much so that I started to play it in a 
  self-taught way, started with covers of songs, and then playing in a 
  small reggae musical group.

  <p>
  And it's in the sports where I wake up my alter ego, my competitive 
  self that does not allow itself to bend before adversity and fight to 
  the end. Group sports such as Rugby printed on me the value of 
  teamwork, respect for the rival and the referee, Karate taught me the 
  discipline, self-respect and Cycling gives me the satisfaction of 
  seeing how work hard and sacrifice has its reward in the end.
