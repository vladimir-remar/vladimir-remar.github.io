	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  	<p>I was born in Huancayo-Peru, I lived the first years of my childhood in this city, at that time I lived in my grandparents' house and we shared the house with uncles, cousins and grandparents, it could be said that there was life on all four sides of the house . According to my father, my grandparents were engaged in agriculture and a large part of the family as well, a circumstance that allowed me to interact with farm animals (cows, sheep, etc.)</p>
