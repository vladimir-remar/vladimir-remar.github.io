One of the most dramatic seizures of the commons over the past century 
happened right in our streets. Public roads that once belonged to 
everyone— kids, old people, the poor— are now are the exclusive 
property of motorists. This is true even in countries where the 
majority of the population do not own cars. In a lot of places, 
crossing the street on foot qualifies as high-risk behavior.

This is an unrecognized tragedy for people who suffer new constraints 
in mobility, such as in India where pedestrian fatalities are 
skyrocketing. But it’s a tragedy for us all as pollution, noise, sprawl 
and global warming worsen under the escalating levels of traffic, while 
our sense of neighborliness withers as we retreat from one another 
behind the windshield.
