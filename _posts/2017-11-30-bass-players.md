As in many situations, personal taste trumped Vulcan logic. Here at 
Bass Player, we’re quite a diverse lot, so a big part of the fun was 
engaging in passionate conversations about why a player should or 
shouldn’t be included, and deciding how high or low players should be 
ranked. No single contributor would have arrived at this exact list, 
but we can (almost) all agree on the Top 10.

- James Jamerson
- Jaco Pastorius
- Paul MacCartney
- Marcus Miller
- Victor Wooten
- Michael Peter Balzary aka "Flea"
- Steve Harris
- Ray Brown
- Stanley Clarke
- Cliff Burton
